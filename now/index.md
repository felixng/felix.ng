#### Where's Sunny This Weekend?

_Where's Sunny This Weekend?_ is a side project I recently started. Being an expat in UK, we all want to ultilise our time traveling through Europe, especially when the weather is shitty in London. Based on a finite list of destination, it will tell you what cities are potentially sunny this coming weekend.

The idea of having a website that tells you which part of Europe or the world is sunny in the near future would allow us to spontanously go on a weekend trip exploring Europe without having to manually search through a list of destinations one by one on [Weather.com](https://weather.com){:target="_blank"} or similar websites.

#### Shoulders Mobility and 5x5 

Also working on loosening my stiff shoulders and improving the scapular mobility to see if that helps my handstand a little bit more, as well as starting [5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/){:target="_blank"} at the gym again earlier this year.
