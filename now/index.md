#### The Show Must Go Online 

Decided to pick up some new tech during the coronavirus lockdown / self isolation period so played around with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/){:target="_blank"}, [GrapghQL](https://graphql.org/){:target="_blank"} with Airtable as database and built [The Shows Must Go Online](https://theshowsmustgo.online/){:target="_blank"} as a fun little side project to keep track of what shows are available to stream online for free during the pandemic.

#### Circusbase

Started [Circusbase](https://circusbase.com){:target="_blank"} last year and still slowly working on it on the side, whenever I have some free time.
