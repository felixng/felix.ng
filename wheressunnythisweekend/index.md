_Where's Sunny This Weekend?_ is a project I am currently working on for fun. A fellow London living friend who was left behind by his wife wanted to go somewhere sunny for a weekend away in Feburary, yet failed to locate a single sunny city nearby through searching one by one on Weather.com.

> If only there is a web app that shows me where's sunny I could go to this weekend, without me having to search city by city, that would be awesome.

This is how this mini project was born.  It also serves as a side project to revive my passion in building little things that excites me.
