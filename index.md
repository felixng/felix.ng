Hong Konger in London, working as a software developer at decent tech company. Passionate about a lot of things, check out what I am working on [now](https://felix.ng/now) 💡

### 💻 Work

Previously worked as a proper corporate monkey - a Web Developer at [Euromoney](http://www.euromoneyplc.com/), one of Europe's largest business and financial magazine publishers. Worked in the Hong Kong office, and their London headquarters.
Now Software Developer at [Trainline](https://thetrainline.com/), coding all the payment related services and APIs.

### 🚀 Side Projects

Strong believer of side projects and indie businesses. Fiddled with a lot of random ideas and projects related to my passions. None has worked out well enough to make me good money, but none has stopped me from trying.

### 🏋 What else do I do?

I code and I travel. I go to theatre, a lot. I also dance, tumble and practise handbalancing. Trying to bulk up, as well as keeping and/or improving my mobility so that I can continue doing those things.

### 🙌 Successes

Relocated across the globe. Lived in three continents. Travel often, and relatively healthy.

### 🤦‍ Failures

Still yet to figure out what I actually want, and still being a corporate monkey of some sort.  Continously define myself by other people's view, yet find a way to accept myself as who I am.  And I hardly save any money.
