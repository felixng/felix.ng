Hong Konger in London, working as a software developer at a tech company. Passionate about a lot of things. 
Strong believer of side projects and indie businesses. Check out what I am working on [now](/now) 💡

#### 💻 Work

Software Developer at [Trainline](https://thetrainline.com/){:target="_blank"}, started working on their desktop website last year.  Previously handling all their payments related backend services and APIs.

#### 🚀 Side Projects

 Fiddled with a lot of random ideas and projects related to my passions. 

[MVMT](https://mvmt.felix.ng){:target="_blank"}, a directory of the top movement related studios and centres in London. [Project Curious Name](https://curiousincident.herokuapp.com/){:target="_blank"} that calculates if the alphabets of your name add up to a prime number. Inspired by the awards-winning theatrical play [The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time](https://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/shows/the-curious-incident-of-the-dog-in-the-night-time){:target="_blank"}, where they have a small price for audience members with a prime number name.

None has worked out well enough, but none has stopped me from keep on trying. 

Recently started [Circusbase](https://circusbase.com){:target="_blank"} and [The Shows Must Go Online](https://theshowsmustgo.online/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 🏋 What else do I do?

I code and I travel. I go to theatre, a lot. I also dance, tumble and practise [handbalancing](http://thecircusdictionary.com/moves/?category=hand-balance){:target="_blank"}.

Trying to bulk up, as well as keeping and/or improving my mobility so that I can continue doing these things.
